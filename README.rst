ORIGEN API Demonstration Repository
===================================

This is a repository for helping others use the ORIGEN API by providing
documentation and simple linking scripts with CMake.

Although the ORIGEN API is export controlled and you must obtain it
through `<https://rsicc.ornl.gov>`_ in the latest version of
`SCALE <https://scale.ornl.gov>`_, the *documentation of the API* 
is open.

Also, C++ and Fortran source that uses the API is also open. 
It is only when it is compiled and linked against ORIGEN libraries that
it becomes export controlled.

That means we can post example source code here and share it easily.

Here is a link to the ORIGEN API
`Doxygen documentation <https://wawiesel.github.io/OrigenAPI-Demo/>`_.

Check out the Examples page!

Linking To The ORIGEN API
-------------------------

If you know the installation directory of SCALE, then it should
be a fairly simple process.  See the "Linking" section of the
`Doxygen documentation <https://wawiesel.github.io/OrigenAPI-Demo/>`_.

Coming Soon
-----------

We will add some demonstration code that you can link against to verify
your ORIGEN install through SCALE is working properly.
