ORIGEN API Demonstration Repository
===================================

This is a repository for helping others use the ORIGEN API by providing
documentation and simple linking scripts with CMake.

Although the ORIGEN API is export controlled and you must obtain it
through `<https://rsicc.ornl.gov>`_ in the latest version of
`SCALE <https://scale.ornl.gov>`_, the *documentation of the API* 
is open.

Here is a link to the ORIGEN API
`Doxygen documentation <https://wawiesel.github.io/OrigenAPI-Demo/>`_.

Check out the Examples!

Linking To The ORIGEN API
-------------------------

If you know the installation directory of SCALE, then it should
be a fairly simple process.  See the "Linking" section of the
`Doxygen documentation <https://wawiesel.github.io/OrigenAPI-Demo/>`_.

Coming Soon
-----------

We will add some demonstration code that you can link against to verify
your ORIGEN install through SCALE is working properly.
